# SEEDLabForARM64
SEEDLab for devices running on ARM64 architecture, such as Macbooks with M1/M2 processors.

This repository contains a collection of Seed Labs and VMware image of SEEDUbuntu that supports ARM64 architecture. The goal is to adapt SEEDLabs for arm64 architecture so as to enable students and professionals using newer MacBook models with M1 or M2 chips to fully engage in these hands-on cybersecurity exercises without using cloud. 

## Getting Started
+ Download and install VMware Fusion player (free for personal use). https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal-13
+ Download the SeedUbuntu image zip file from : https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/njk5270_psu_edu/ESGXJv-Y23lBhNzwozva9e0BEpKxY11Y7hFpL8fvdbjmhA?e=zqrgJm
+ Extract zip file
+ Open the extracted file with VMware Fusion. If it asks whether you copied or moved it, select copied.
+ You should be able to run and log in to the SeddLab virtual machine.
+ Find and use the relevant Labsetup files from this repo.

  
## Why ARM64 Conversion Matters
With the introduction of Apple's M1 and M2 chips, there is a growing need to ensure that educational materials like SeedLabs remain accessible and functional for users with these newer devices.

This project is still in its testing phase. We will be testing this on Ubuntu22 image using VMware Fusion Player. More details to be updated. For now, the ubuntu version is not the same as the official SEEDLab's due to time and budget constraints but I plan to update it in the near future. The primary goal is to quickly provide an alternative to cloud VMs for students during Fall 2023 semester.

This would primarily be used for CMPSC443 Fall 2023 students for a total of 6 labs. We will update settings/configuration as needed by the end of the semester.

## Disclaimer
Users may encounter occasional issues. More testing is needed. 
## Contributions
Contributions to further improve the ARM64 adaptation of SeedLabs are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, or additional labs you've adapted for ARM64 architecture.
