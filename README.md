# SEEDLabForARM64
SEEDLab for devices running on ARM64 architecture such as Macbooks with M1/M2 processors.

This repository contains a collection of Seed Labs and VMware image of SEEDUbuntu that supports ARM64 architecture. The goal is to adapt SEEDLabs for arm64 architecture so as to enable students and professionals using newer MacBook models with M1 or M2 chips to fully engage in these hands-on cybersecurity exercises without using cloud. 

##Why ARM64 Conversion Matters:
With the introduction of Apple's M1 and M2 chips, there is a growing need to ensure that educational materials like SeedLabs remain accessible and functional for users with these newer devices. 


##Note
Code taken from https://github.com/seed-labs and modifed to run on ARM64
This has not been tested for all the labs extensively. This would primarily be used for CMPSC443 Fall 2023 students for total of 6 labs. We will update settings/configuration as needed by end of the semester.

##Disclaimer
Users may encounter occasional issues. This has not been tested for all the labs extensively. 
##Contributions
Contributions to further improve the ARM64 adaptation of SeedLabs are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, or additional labs that you've adapted for ARM64 architecture.
